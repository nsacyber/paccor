paccor is a popular solution for creating the TCG Platform Certificate. The platform certificate enables traceability in the hardware supply chain of a computing device.


This hardware manifest plugin encapsulates paccor's shell scripts into a .NET package. This allows paccor's hardware evidence collection to be integrated into any .NET program that can [manage](https://www.nuget.org/packages/paccor.HardwareManifestPluginManager) the [IHardwareManifestPlugin interface](https://www.nuget.org/packages/paccor.HardwareManifestPlugin).

See the [HIRS .NET Provisioner](https://github.com/nsacyber/hirs/) code on github for an example usage of this plugin.
